Using the power of reinforcement learning through artificial intelligence, 
we trained a model to identify hate oriented and threatening speech in online postings. 
The program also maps people across various platforms in an effort to get a fuller story of what is going on. 
Through these efforts, the program identifies potential threats and utilizes an API to alert authorities 
for follow up on threats identified.
